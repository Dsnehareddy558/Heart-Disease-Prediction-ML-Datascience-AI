## **Project Name – Heart Disease Prediction using ML, Data Science & AI**

### **Objective**
To analyze medical patient data and build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease.  
The project includes Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Scaling, Model Training, Evaluation, and an AI-based prediction function.  
The goal is to identify key health factors affecting heart disease and develop a reliable predictive system.

### **Tasks Performed**
- Loaded and inspected the heart disease dataset  
- Removed unnecessary columns and checked for missing values  
- Performed EDA using visualizations (distribution plots, boxplots, heatmaps)  
- Analyzed relationships between age, BP, chest pain type, cholesterol, and heart disease  
- Scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**  
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- Trained two machine learning models:  
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  - **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Evaluated models using accuracy score and classification report  
- Built an **AI Prediction Function** to predict heart disease from new patient inputs 

### **Tools / Technologies Used**
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
(Logistic Regression, Random Forest, StandardScaler, Train-Test Split)

### **Key Results**
- **Logistic Regression Accuracy:** 91% (best-performing model)  
- **Random Forest Accuracy:** 87%  
- EDA highlighted strong patterns between:
  - Chest pain type  
  - Max heart rate  
  - ST depression  
  - Exercise angina  
- Final AI function successfully predicts whether a person has **high or low chance of heart disease**
